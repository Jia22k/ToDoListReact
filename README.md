# ToDoListReact

**Project Description**  
This project serves as a practical learning exercise for students exploring web application frameworks. The primary task is to develop a 'To Do' application that can be implemented using any SPA (Single Page Application) framework along with a compatible material library. Examples include React with Material-UI, Angular with Angular Material, or Vue with Vuetify. For this course, Vue paired with Vuetify is recommended to ensure compatibility and support during class debug sessions.

**Preview**  
The application is designed to provide a simple yet effective user experience in managing tasks:
- **Launch**: Open the application to start managing tasks.
- **Add Tasks**: Utilize an 'Add' button to input task details into the system.
- **View Tasks**: Tasks are displayed in a table format, allowing for easy reading and management.
- **Update Tasks**: Tasks can be updated as needed using an 'Update' button, ensuring the list remains current and useful.
